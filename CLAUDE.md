# Tomo - AI Travel Companion

---

## 🚨 SESSION 16 PRIORITY: COMPLETE THE APP 🚨

**Goal:** Make Tomo the BEST travel app in the world - fully functional, polished, production-ready.

### IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Fix First)

1. **REBUILD DEV CLIENT** - App won't start due to native module mismatch
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean && npx expo run:ios
   ```
   Error: `NativeJSLogger.default.addListener is not a function`

### PHASE 1: Code Quality (40 Issues Found in Session 15)

A deep analysis found these critical issues that MUST be fixed:

| Priority | Issue | File | Fix |
|----------|-------|------|-----|
| HIGH | Zustand anti-pattern | `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:183` | Remove `getMemoriesByType` from useMemo deps |
| HIGH | Missing null checks | `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:266` | Add `if (!coordinates) return;` |
| HIGH | Global session state | `services/realtime.ts:42` | Move session to Zustand store |
| HIGH | Offline queue not retried | `stores/useOfflineStore.ts` | Add retry on reconnect |
| MEDIUM | Empty catch blocks | `services/realtime.ts:395` | Add proper error logging |
| MEDIUM | No Error Boundary | `app/_layout.tsx` | Wrap app in ErrorBoundary |
| MEDIUM | No API key validation | `app/_layout.tsx` | Check keys on startup |

### PHASE 2: Set Up Claude Code Power Features

Create `.claude/` structure for productivity:

```
.claude/
├── agents/
│   ├── ios-expert.md        # React Native iOS specialist
│   ├── api-expert.md        # OpenAI/Google API debugging
│   ├── tester.md            # Runs tests, fixes failures

│   └── review.md            # /review - code quality check
└── settings.json            # Hooks for auto-format, auto-test
```

### PHASE 3: Device Testing Checklist

Test on REAL iPhone (not simulator):

| Feature | Test Method | Expected |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Maps | Open Map tab | Google Maps renders with markers |
| Location | Grant permission | Shows real location, updates |
| Camera | Tap camera icon | Take photo → select prompt → AI responds |
| Voice | Tap mic | WebSocket connects, voice works |
| Navigation | "Take me there" | Opens /navigation with compass |
| Offline | Toggle airplane mode | Shows offline banner, queues messages |
| Itinerary | "Plan my day" in chat | Creates full itinerary |

### PHASE 4: Final Polish

- [ ] Test all user flows end-to-end
- [ ] Fix any UI glitches
- [ ] Verify all API integrations
- [ ] Test offline → online transition
- [ ] Performance check (no jank, fast loads)

### The Vision We're Building

**Three Types of Travelers:**

1. **The Planner** 📋
   - Opens Tomo before trip
   - "Plan my 3 days in Tokyo"
   - Gets full itinerary on map
   - Optimizes route
   - Adds to calendar

2. **The Free Spirit** 🌊
   - Opens Tomo when hungry
   - "I'm craving ramen"
   - Gets perfect spot nearby
   - "Take me there"
   - Navigates with compass

3. **The In-Betweener** 🔄
   - Has loose plan
   - "What else is near Shibuya?"
   - Discovers hidden gems
   - Adds to itinerary on the fly

**Every feature serves these users. If it doesn't, cut it.**

---

## The Vision

**Tomo = The ONLY app a traveler needs**

Not Google Maps + TripAdvisor + Translate + ChatGPT + Booking.com. Just Tomo.

A travel companion that:
- Answers ANY question (general AI + travel superpowers)
- Knows your location, time, weather, budget in real-time
- Works for planners AND spontaneous travelers
- Works offline when you lose signal
- Takes action (navigate, book, remind)
- Feels like a local friend, not a tool

**Core Philosophy:** Minimum friction, maximum value. Every feature must earn its place.

---

## FIXED: App Now Running (Session 12)

**Root Cause Found:** React Native 0.81.5's New Architecture has a bug in `RCTLegacyViewManagerInteropComponentView` that crashes when setting props on legacy native views at startup.

### The Fix (Session 12)
1. **Disabled New Architecture** (`newArchEnabled: false` in app.json)
2. **Downgraded react-native-maps** from v1.26 (requires New Arch) to v1.19.1 (works with Old Arch)
3. **Removed maps plugin** from app.config.js (v1.19.1 doesn't have a config plugin)

### What's Working
- ✅ App launches and runs
- ✅ All tab screens (Tomo, Plan, Map, Saved, You)
- ✅ Onboarding flow
- ✅ Lucide icons (react-native-svg)
- ✅ SafeAreaProvider
- ✅ Chat navigation
- ⚠️ Maps may need additional native config for Google Maps API key

### Known Limitations
- **New Architecture disabled** - Some performance optimizations unavailable
- **react-native-maps v1.19.1** - Older version, may lack some features
- **Maps API Key** - Need to configure Google Maps API key manually in native code

---

## STATUS ASSESSMENT: ~95% Working (Session 14/15 Update)

---

## REMAINING GAPS

### 1. ✅ Offline Mode - FIXED
Services now check `useOfflineStore.getState().isOnline`:
- `services/openai.ts` - queues messages when offline, returns friendly offline response
- `services/places.ts` - returns empty results when offline
- Chat shows "I'm offline right now" message
- Messages queued for when connection returns

### 2. ✅ Voice Mode - WORKING (Session 13)
Voice mode now uses `gpt-realtime` model:
- WebSocket connection to `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`
- Full voice-to-voice conversation
- Real-time transcription + speech synthesis
- Tap mic → speak → Tomo responds with voice

### 3. ✅ Memory Extraction - WORKING (Session 13)
Now uses GPT-4o-mini for intelligent extraction + feeds back into chat:
```typescript
// hooks/useMemoryExtraction.ts:
// 1. Sends user messages to gpt-4o-mini for preference extraction
// 2. Falls back to regex patterns if AI unavailable/offline
// 3. Shows "Tomo learned" notification when preferences detected
// 4. Memories feed into buildSystemPrompt() for personalized responses

// NOW catches natural language:
"I try to avoid meat" ✅ → dietary preference
"No beef for me" ✅ → dietary restriction
"My daughter is allergic to nuts" ✅ → allergy info
"We prefer quiet restaurants" ✅ → place preference
```

### 4. Notification Triggers Need Data to Fire

The triggers run every 30 seconds but require:

| Trigger | Requirement | In Fresh App |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Budget warning | User must set budget AND log spending | ❌ Empty |
| Weather alert | Weather must be fetched AND change | ❌ No fetch trigger |
| Itinerary reminder | User must create itinerary with times | ❌ Empty |
| Place closing | Activity must have place with hours | ❌ No activities |

**In a fresh app with no user data, ZERO notifications will ever fire.**

---

## API Requirements

| Environment Variable | Required For | Status |
|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` | All AI features | **REQUIRED** |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | Places, photos, open status | **REQUIRED** |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY` | Weather data | Optional (has mock fallback) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_WHISPER_BACKEND_URL` | Voice-to-text transcription | **REQUIRES BACKEND DEPLOYMENT** |

### Voice Mode: OpenAI Realtime API Setup

The voice mode uses OpenAI's Realtime API for real-time voice conversations.

**What You Need:**
1. **OpenAI API Key** - Your existing `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **API Access** - Realtime API is now fully rolled out to all API users
3. **Model Access** - Uses `gpt-realtime` (latest stable)

**How It Works:**
- WebSocket connection to `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`
- Real-time voice-to-voice (no separate transcription step)
- Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for natural turn-taking
- Audio streaming: PCM16 format at 24kHz

**Pricing (as of Dec 2024):**
- Audio input: ~$0.06 per minute
- Audio output: ~$0.24 per minute
- This is separate from standard GPT-4o pricing

**To Enable Voice Mode:**
1. Ensure your OpenAI account has Realtime API access
2. Check at https://platform.openai.com/settings (look for Realtime models)
3. Your `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` should work if Realtime is enabled
4. Open the app → tap voice button → connection should succeed

**Testing Voice Mode:**
```bash
# Check if your key has realtime access
curl -X GET "https://api.openai.com/v1/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  | grep "realtime"
```

**Troubleshooting:**
| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | API key lacks realtime access | Check OpenAI dashboard for Realtime API access |
| `Model not found` | Model not available to account | Wait for rollout or contact OpenAI |
| `Connection error` | Network/WebSocket issue | Check firewall, try different network |
| Mic button disabled | Permissions denied | Grant microphone permission in device settings |

**Alternative: Whisper Backend (Push-to-Talk)**
`services/voice.ts` supports a separate push-to-talk mode using Whisper:
- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_WHISPER_BACKEND_URL` to your backend
- Backend must accept POST `/transcribe` with audio file
- Return `{ text: "transcription" }`
- This is NOT currently wired into the UI - for future use

### Session 15 (December 20, 2024) - Core Experience Polish

**Critical Fixes:**
- ✅ **Fixed Model Names**: Corrected from fake "gpt-5.2/gpt-5-mini" to real "gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini"
- ✅ **Fixed expo-build-properties**: Installed missing plugin that was causing startup crash
- ✅ **Fixed Booking URLs**: Added web fallbacks so Uber/Grab links work without URL schemes

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Itinerary from Chat**: "Plan my day" now creates full itinerary with activities
- ✅ **Intelligent Home Screen**: AI-generated personalized tips based on context
- ✅ **Smart Camera Prompts**: Take photo → choose prompt (Translate, What is this?, etc.)

**Files Modified:**
- `services/openai.ts` - model: gpt-4o
- `services/realtime.ts` - model: gpt-4o-realtime-preview
- `hooks/useMemoryExtraction.ts` - model: gpt-4o-mini

- Full voice mode with `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` WebSocket connection

**OpenAI Models Used:**
- Main Chat: gpt-4o
- Fast tasks: gpt-4o-mini
- Voice Realtime: gpt-4o-realtime-preview

---

### Session 12 (December 19, 2024) - CRASH FIXED + Map Restored

**Root Cause Found:** React Native 0.81.5's New Architecture has a bug in `RCTLegacyViewManagerInteropComponentView` that crashes when setting props on legacy native views at startup.

**The Fix:**
1. **Disabled New Architecture** - Set `newArchEnabled: false` in app.json
2. **Downgraded react-native-maps** - From v1.26 (requires New Arch) to v1.19.1 (works with Old Arch)
3. **Removed maps plugin** - app.config.js no longer needs react-native-maps plugin (v1.19.1 doesn't have one)

**Also Fixed:**
- ✅ Restored full MapView in `app/(tabs)/map.tsx` (was placeholder "Coming soon")
- ✅ Changed input placeholder from "Find food nearby" to "What's on your mind?"
- ✅ Improved quick action chips with better time-based labels
- ✅ Fixed Zustand anti-pattern in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (was causing re-render loops)

**App Structure Now:**
```
app/
├── index.tsx              # Root - redirects to (tabs) or onboarding
├── onboarding.tsx         # First-time user flow
├── chat.tsx               # Full chat screen
├── voice.tsx              # Voice mode
├── navigation.tsx         # Turn-by-turn navigation
├── (tabs)/
│   ├── _layout.tsx        # 5-tab navigator
│   ├── index.tsx          # Tomo home "What do you want right now?"
│   ├── plan.tsx           # Itinerary view
│   ├── map.tsx            # Map explorer with MapView
│   ├── saved.tsx          # Saved places list
│   └── you.tsx            # Profile/settings hub
```

### Session 11 (December 18, 2024) - Major Fixes + New Navigation
**UI/UX Overhaul:**
- Created new bottom tab navigation with 5 tabs: Plan, Map, Tomo, Saved, You
- Built new home screen with "What do you want right now?" + proactive suggestions
- Proactive "Right now" cards based on time, location, saved places, weather

**Critical Fixes:**
- ✅ **Offline Mode**: Wired into `services/openai.ts` and `services/places.ts`
- ✅ **Memory Extraction**: Upgraded to AI-powered (gpt-4o-mini) with regex fallback
- ✅ **Voice Mode Docs**: Comprehensive guide for OpenAI Realtime API setup

**New Files:**
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tab navigator
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Tomo home with proactive suggestions
- `app/(tabs)/plan.tsx` - Itinerary view
- `app/(tabs)/map.tsx` - Map explorer
- `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx` - Saved places
- `app/(tabs)/you.tsx` - Profile/settings hub
- `app/chat.tsx` - Full chat screen (non-tab)

### Session 10 (December 18, 2024) - FAANG Analysis
**Honest assessment revealed:**
- Previous 95% claim was incorrect
- Offline mode completely broken (store exists, never used)
- Voice features require external infrastructure
- Memory extraction is regex-only
- Notification triggers need user data to fire

### Session 10 Earlier - Wiring Features

- `services/realtime.ts` - OpenAI Realtime WebSocket
- `services/booking.ts` - Deep link generators
- Added `modifyItinerary()` to `services/openai.ts`
- Wired BackgroundTriggers in `app/_layout.tsx`

### Session 9 (December 18, 2024)
- Real navigation chat (replaced hardcoded)
- Full itinerary UI
- Notification system UI
- Offline mode store + banner

### Session 8 (December 18, 2024)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development (simulator)
npx expo start --dev-client

# Development (with tunnel for physical device)
npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# LOCAL build for physical device (EAS credits exhausted)
npx expo run:ios --device

# Clear cache if issues
npx expo start --clear

# Git
git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main
```

---

## Testing on Physical iPhone

To test features like maps, location, compass, and voice on a real device:

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended)
1. **Build the dev client once:**
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```
2. **Install on iPhone:**
   - Scan the QR code from EAS after build completes
   - OR download the .ipa and install via TestFlight/AltStore
3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel
   ```
4. **Scan the QR code** in the Expo terminal with your iPhone camera

### Option 2: Expo Go (Limited)
- Expo Go won't work for this app because we use custom native modules (react-native-maps)
- Use the development build approach above

### What Requires Physical Device Testing
| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Maps** | Google Maps rendering, gestures |
| **Location** | Real GPS, permissions |
| **Compass/Navigation** | Magnetometer sensor |
| **Voice** | Microphone, real-time audio |
| **Offline mode** | Toggle airplane mode |
| **Haptics** | Physical feedback |

### Troubleshooting
- **"Unable to resolve"**: Run `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache
- **Build fails**: Check `eas build --platform ios --local` for detailed logs
- **Maps not showing**: Verify Google Maps API key in environment variables

## The North Star

**When a traveler lands in a new city, Tomo should be:**
1. The FIRST app they open (not Google Maps)
2. The ONLY app they need for the day
3. The app they TELL their friends about

**This happens when:**
| Requirement | Status | Gap |
|-------------|--------|-----|
